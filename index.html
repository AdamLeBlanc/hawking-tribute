              Hawking was born on January 8, 1942 to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking in Oxford, England. His parents both attended the
              University of Oxford. He had two younger sisters and an adopted brother.

              focus on pursuits outside of school. This included playing and creating board games, as well as creating computers
              out of recycled parts for solving basic math problems.

              Hawking began attending Oxford at the age of 17. He wished to major in mathematics, but as Ocford did not offer this degree
              he went into Cosmology. He found the work too easy and barley studied, which caused him to have difficulty
              with "factual" knowledge question, however, he excelled at problem solving.

              Hawking had his thesis approved and recieved his PHD in mathematics and theoretical physics. He based his work on expanding
              the theory that there is a singularity at the center of a black hole to the entire Universe. At the time there
              was great debate between two competing theorie on the creation of the Universe:
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">The Big Bang</a> and
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_State_theory">Steady State</a> theories. Hawkings thesis took the side of the Big Bang, proposing that the Universe started
              as a singularity.

              After getting his PHD he was given a research fellowship at Cambridge.

            <p>
              Hawking proposed that we live in a none-bound, closed universe. Meaning that prior to the Plank Time at the begining of the
              Universe, there was space, but no time. Since the universe began as a singularity in both space and time, there
              were no initial bounds in either for the universe. Therefore the universe has no beginning, since the concept
              of a beginning without time is meaningless. The singularity is similar to the North Pole. You cannot be more
              North than the North Pole, but there is also no boundary there. It is simply the point where all paths North
              meet and end. This model also predicts a closed universe.

              a big success, and made it to the top of the best sellers list in many countries. This helped his financial
              situation greatly, but also brought many challenges that come with being famous. He had little time for work
